AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) vs AWS API Gateway

These two AWS services are completely different and serve distinct purposes in a network architecture. The confusion is common because both are "gateway" services, but they operate at different layers of the network stack and handle different types of traffic.

Here is a breakdown of what each service does and how they differ.

AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
What it is: A managed load balancer that operates at the network layer (Layer 3).

Primary Purpose: To provide a transparent and scalable way to deploy, manage, and scale fleets of third-party virtual appliances. Think of it as a specialized load balancer for network security and analysis tools.

How it works: GWLB sits in front of virtual appliances like firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and deep packet inspection (DPI) systems. All network traffic, regardless of protocol, is routed to the GWLB, which then forwards the packets to a healthy appliance in its target group. After the appliance inspects and processes the traffic, it sends the packets back to the GWLB, which then forwards them to their original destination.

Key Use Case: Centralizing network security and inspection. This allows an organization to insert a "bump-in-the-wire" security device into the traffic path without changing network routes or configurations.

AWS API Gateway
What it is: A fully managed service that acts as a "front door" for your application programming interfaces (APIs). It operates at the application layer (Layer 7).

Primary Purpose: To create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale.

How it works: API Gateway is designed specifically for API traffic. It handles all the tasks involved in accepting API calls, including authentication, authorization, throttling, and traffic management. 
It then routes those requests to a back-end service, such as an AWS Lambda function, an EC2 instance, or any publicly accessible web service.

Key Use Case: Building microservices and serverless applications. It provides a single, unified endpoint for clients to interact with your back-end services, simplifying development and management.

Summary of Differences
Feature	AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)	AWS API Gateway
Network Layer	Layer 3 (Network Layer)	Layer 7 (Application Layer)
Traffic Type	Any IP packets (TCP, UDP, etc.)	API traffic (HTTP, REST, WebSocket)
Core Function	Routes packets to virtual appliances for inspection and security.	Acts as a front door for APIs, handling requests and routing them to back-end services.
Primary Use Case	Deploying firewalls, IDS/IPS, and other network security appliances.	Building and managing APIs for microservices and serverless applications.
Backend Targets	Virtual appliances (e.g., EC2 instances with firewall software).	AWS Lambda functions, EC2 instances, other AWS services, or any public HTTP endpoint.

Export to Sheets
In short, think of the Gateway Load Balancer as a security-focused network device that ensures all your network traffic is inspected by an appliance before it reaches its destination. 
API Gateway, on the other hand, is an application-focused service that manages all your API endpoints and their interactions with your back-end code. They are not the same, 
and they would be used together in a complex architecture, with GWLB handling the low-level network traffic inspection and API Gateway handling the high-level API management.
