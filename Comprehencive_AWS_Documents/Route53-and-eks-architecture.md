# Route 53 and EKS Architecture

## The Problem Route 53 Solves

Imagine you have a phone number for your friend, and they change their number every hour. You couldn't call them! The internet has the same problem: your microservices in EKS have constantly changing addresses (IP addresses).

The role of Route 53 is to give your applications a stable, easy-to-remember name (like flashapp.com) and make sure that name always points to the correct, changing address of your service.

Think of Route 53 as a "dynamic phone book".
--------------------------------------------------------

The Key Players in Your Architecture
Before we get to the steps, let's understand the simple roles of each component:

 - You, the User: The person typing a web address into a browser.

 - The Domain Name: The easy name you buy (e.g., api.flashapp.com).

 - Route 53: AWS's DNS service. It's the phone book. It holds a record that says, "When someone asks for api.flashapp.com, give them this address: 52.200.1.1."

 - The Load Balancer: A single entry point for all your traffic. Think of it as a "doorman". It has one stable address that Route 53 points to. Its job is to look at a request and send it to the right microservice.

 - EKS Cluster: The environment where your microservices live.

 - Pods: The individual microservices (e.g., your product service, user service, order service). These are the apartments in the EKS cluster building.

### Step-by-Step Flow with ASCII Diagrams

Let's follow one request from a user's browser all the way to a single microservice.

**Step 1: The User's Request**
The user wants to buy something, so they type a web address into their browser.

The browser doesn't know the IP address for api.flashapp.com. So, it needs to look it up.

**Step 2: The DNS Lookup (Route 53)**
The browser's first stop is the internet's phone book, which is Route 53.

Route 53's role is complete here. It gave the browser the correct IP address for your load balancer.

**Step 3: Hitting the Load Balancer**
Now the browser knows the address, so it sends the request directly to that IP address. This IP belongs to your Application Load Balancer (ALB).

The Load Balancer accepts the request and looks inside it. It sees the request is for the /products path.

**Step 4: The Routing to the Microservice**
The Load Balancer uses its internal rules to send the request to the correct microservice running in EKS.

The Pod for the product microservice processes the request and sends the response back through the same path to the user.

### Summary of Route 53's Role
Route 53's job is simple but critical:

 - It creates a stable name (api.flashapp.com) that never changes.

 - It links that name to the dynamic address of your Load Balancer, which can change.

 - This link is set up just once. All future changes to your Load Balancer's IP are handled automatically by tools like ExternalDNS, ensuring the api.flashapp.com name is always correct without any manual work from you.

# can you explain your previous answer in detail about Route 52 and EKS: Architecture? #

You're asking about a crucial part of a real-world microservices architecture on AWS. It's great that you want to understand this in detail! Let's simplify the previous explanation with a step-by-step breakdown and a new, detailed diagram that focuses on the role of each component.

1. ** The Goal: A User-Friendly Web Address for Your EKS App **
   The core problem is this: your EKS microservices are not static. Their network addresses (IP addresses) change frequently due to scaling, deployments, or failures. You can't tell a user to visit http://10.0.1.5 because that address might not work in an hour.

The goal is to give your application a stable, human-friendly web address like api.flashapp.com and have the entire system automatically ensure that this name always points to the right place. This is where Route 53 comes in.

2. **The Architecture: A Unified Entry Point**
   In a modern EKS setup, you don't expose each microservice directly to the public internet. Instead, you create a single, public entry point—an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB then acts as a "doorman" for your entire EKS cluster, directing traffic to the correct microservice based on the URL path.

Route 53's job is to link your domain name to this stable ALB.

Here's the detailed, step-by-step flow with an ASCII diagram:
**Step 1: The Kubernetes Ingress Manifest ✍️**

You, the developer, start by creating a Kubernetes file (a "manifest") for an Ingress. This file tells your EKS cluster how to expose a microservice to the outside world. This is where you specify the domain name you want to use.


<pre>
```
# A part of your Kubernetes manifest file
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: flash-product-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
spec:
  rules:
  - host: api.flashapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /products/*
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: flash-product-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
</pre>


***What this does: This YAML file tells Kubernetes: "When a request comes in for api.flashapp.com/products, send it to the flash-product-service running in my cluster."***

<hr>

### Step 2: The AWS Load Balancer Controller 🤖  ###

The AWS Load Balancer Controller is a special program (a "controller") that runs inside your EKS cluster. It's always watching for new Ingress manifests.

When you apply your Ingress manifest, the Load Balancer Controller sees it and says, "Aha, a new request for an internet-facing ALB!" It then goes to the AWS cloud and automatically provisions a brand-new Application Load Balancer for you. 
This ALB is given a public DNS name by AWS (e.g., k8s-default-flash-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com) but doesn't have a simple, human-friendly name yet.

### Step 3: The ExternalDNS Controller 🗺️ ###

Here's where Route 53 gets involved, and this is the "magic" step.

The ExternalDNS controller is another program you install in your EKS cluster. Its job is to watch for services or ingresses that need a public DNS record.

ExternalDNS sees your Ingress manifest and its api.flashapp.com domain name.

It then connects to your Route 53 Hosted Zone (which is where your flashapp.com domain is managed).

It automatically creates a DNS record that points your domain name, api.flashapp.com, to the new ALB's DNS name. This is an Alias Record, which is a special type of Route 53 record designed to point to other AWS resources.

This automation is key: you write one manifest, and the controllers handle the rest.

**Summary**
The role of Route 53 is to provide a static, friendly name (api.flashapp.com) for your application. It uses an Alias Record to point this name to the dynamic DNS name of your Application Load Balancer.
The automation provided by the AWS Load Balancer Controller and ExternalDNS ensures this link is always correct, even if your underlying infrastructure changes.

## 📌 🤔 so according to Step 2: The AWS Load Balancer Controller 🤖 , for every single microservice , load balance controller assigns a seperate load balancer?  ##

That's an excellent follow-up question! The short answer is: no, not necessarily. The AWS Load Balancer Controller is designed to be smart and efficient. While it can create a separate ALB for every Ingress resource, the recommended and most cost-effective approach is to use a single ALB for multiple microservices.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it works:

One ALB for Multiple Microservices 🤝
The AWS Load Balancer Controller supports a feature called IngressGroup, which allows you to group multiple Kubernetes Ingress resources together. When you do this, the controller knows to merge the routing rules from all those Ingresses into a single, unified ALB.


This is the standard and most common practice for several reasons:

 - Cost Savings: You only pay for one ALB instead of many. ALBs can become expensive if you have dozens of microservices.

 - Simplified Management: You only have one public endpoint to manage and secure. This single ALB can handle all your api.flashapp.com traffic.

 - Centralized Routing: All your routing logic (e.g., /products, /users, /orders) is configured on one load balancer, making it easier to manage and monitor.

** How to Configure a Single ALB ⚙️ **
To make this happen, you simply add an annotation to your Ingress manifests, telling the controller that they belong to the same group.

Let's use your flash-product-service as an example, and imagine you have an flash-user-service as well.

 - flash-product-service Ingress:
<pre>
```
metadata:
  name: flash-product-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: flash-app-group # 👈 The key annotation
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
spec:
  rules:
  - host: api.flashapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /products/*
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: flash-product-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
</pre>

 - flash-user-service Ingress:
<pre>
```
metadata:
  name: flash-user-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: flash-app-group # 👈 Same group name!
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
spec:
  rules:
  - host: api.flashapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /users/*
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: flash-user-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
</pre>

By using the same alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name annotation, you're instructing the AWS Load Balancer Controller to combine the routing rules for both /products and /users onto the same Application Load Balancer.

This architecture is the most common and efficient way to handle a microservices API gateway in EKS. You have the flexibility to create multiple Ingresses for each service while still benefiting from a single, centralized load balancer.



## 📌 🤔can you explain what is this ingress, what is its role in eks how does it fit in microservices on kubernetes and aws, is it aws orignal resource or part of kubernetes, what problem it solves? ##

Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that acts as a traffic controller for your cluster. Its main job is to provide a single, unified entry point for external HTTP and HTTPS traffic and route it to the correct microservice running inside your cluster.

1. **What Problem Does It Solve? 🤯**
   By default, services in Kubernetes are internal and can't be reached from outside the cluster. You have a few options to expose them, but each has drawbacks:

NodePort: Exposes a service on a specific port on every node (EC2 instance). This is simple, but requires you to manage firewall rules for each port and uses a non-standard port, which isn't good for web traffic.

LoadBalancer: Automatically provisions a cloud load balancer for each service. This is great, but it can get very expensive very fast. If you have 10 microservices, you would have to pay for 10 separate load balancers.

Ingress solves these problems by providing a more intelligent, centralized, and cost-effective way to expose multiple services.

2. **Is It an AWS Resource or a Kubernetes Resource?  🤔**
   Ingress is a native Kubernetes API resource. You create an Ingress object using standard Kubernetes YAML files. However, an Ingress object by itself doesn't do anything. It's just a set of rules.


To make it work, you need an Ingress Controller. This is a program that runs inside your cluster, watches for new Ingress resources, and then implements those rules by setting up a load balancer and configuring its routing.

In the context of AWS, the AWS Load Balancer Controller is the specific Ingress Controller you install on your EKS cluster. It translates your Kubernetes Ingress rules into a physical AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB).

So, the Ingress object is part of Kubernetes, but its implementation (the actual load balancer) is an AWS resource managed by a controller.

3. **Its Role in Microservices on Kubernetes and AWS 🛠️**
   Ingress is a foundational component for microservices architectures. It allows you to:

- Consolidate Traffic: Instead of having a separate IP address and load balancer for each service, you can use a single Ingress to expose all your microservices through one central load balancer. This drastically reduces cost and complexity.

- Define Routing Rules: You can create simple, clear rules for how traffic is routed. For example:

- Requests to api.flashapp.com/products go to the flash-product-service.

- Requests to api.flashapp.com/users go to the flash-user-service.

- Manage TLS/SSL: You can terminate SSL/TLS encryption at the Ingress layer, so your application pods don't have to handle the heavy lifting of encryption and decryption. This centralizes certificate management.

- Enable Virtual Hosting: You can host multiple domains on the same load balancer. For instance, api.flashapp.com and support.flashapp.com could both be served by the same ALB, with traffic routed to different microservices.

## 📌 🤔 so do you use ingress or load balancer in aws based kubernetes microservices? ##
You use both Ingress and a load balancer in AWS-based Kubernetes microservices, but they serve different roles. Ingress is the Kubernetes resource that defines routing rules, while an AWS Load Balancer is the physical infrastructure that implements those rules. In an EKS environment, a specialized program called the AWS Load Balancer Controller acts as the bridge between the two.

***Ingress: The Rulebook 📄***
Ingress is a Kubernetes object that you define in a YAML file. It is not a service itself, but a collection of rules for how to route external traffic to your services. It works at Layer 7 of the OSI model (the application layer) and allows for advanced routing based on HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

**Key features:**

**Path-based routing:** api.flashapp.com/products goes to the product microservice, while api.flashapp.com/users goes to the user microservice.

**Host-based routing:** app.flashapp.com goes to one service, while docs.flashapp.com goes to another.

**TLS/SSL termination:** It can handle HTTPS traffic, decrypting it before it reaches your microservices.

An Ingress object is just a set of instructions; it needs a controller to make it happen.

### The Load Balancer: The Physical Infrastructure 🏗️ ###
A load balancer is a network device or service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets. In AWS, this is typically an Application Load Balancer (ALB). An ALB has a single public IP address and DNS name that is the entry point for all your traffic.

**Key features:**

**High availability and scalability:** Automatically handles traffic spikes and is designed to be fault-tolerant.

**Centralized entry point:** A single endpoint for all your microservices, reducing cost and management overhead compared to having a separate load balancer for each service.

#### How They Work Together in AWS 🤝 ####
***Here's the process in an EKS environment:***

 - 1 You write a Kubernetes Ingress manifest with your desired routing rules and apply it to your EKS cluster.

 - 2 The AWS Load Balancer Controller, which is a pod running in your cluster, detects this new Ingress object.

 - 3 The controller then provisions and configures a single AWS Application Load Balancer on your behalf.

 - 4 It translates your Ingress rules into listener rules on the ALB, telling it exactly where to send traffic for different URLs and paths.

 - 5 Finally, you use a DNS service like Route 53 to point your domain name (api.flashapp.com) to the DNS name of the newly created ALB.

This combined approach is the standard and most cost-effective way to expose multiple microservices on EKS. You get the benefits of Kubernetes's declarative Ingress resource while leveraging the robust, managed infrastructure of AWS ALBs.

##  📌 🤔 so ingress is also path based routing and according to your statement, in loadbalancer :L The controller then provisions and configures a single AWS Application Load Balancer on your behalf. ##

## It translates your Ingress rules into listener rules on the ALB, telling it exactly where to send traffic for different URLs and paths., this is also sending traffic to diff urls and paths, i am confused ! ##


That's a very common point of confusion. You've correctly identified that both are involved in path-based routing, but their roles are completely different. Think of it this way:

- Ingress is the instruction manual. 📝

- Load Balancer is the factory. 🏭

You are confused because the LoadBalancer's job is to do exactly what the Ingress tells it to do. The Ingress doesn't do the work itself; it just provides the rules.

***The Clear Distinction***
Feature	Ingress	Load Balancer (ALB)
Role	Ruleset. Defines what traffic should be routed and how (paths, hosts, etc.).	Implementation. Is the physical resource that actually receives and routes the traffic.
Location	Inside Kubernetes. It's a declarative Kubernetes API object.	In AWS. It's a physical piece of networking infrastructure.
Existence	It is just a configuration file (YAML). It has no IP address.	It is a running service with a DNS name and an IP address.
Cost	Free. It's a Kubernetes object.	Charged by AWS based on usage.
The Bridge	Ingress Controller reads these rules to create the ALB.	Ingress Controller provisions and configures this based on Ingress rules.

***The Step-by-Step Flow***
Here is the exact flow that happens, clarifying who does what:

 - 1 You write the Ingress YAML. You create a file with routing rules: "If the path is /products, send it to the product service." This is the instruction manual.

- 2 You apply the Ingress YAML to your EKS cluster. Kubernetes now knows these rules exist.

- 3 The AWS Load Balancer Controller (the "factory manager") sees the new Ingress. It reads your ruleset.

- 4 The Controller provisions a new ALB in AWS. It creates the physical Load Balancer with a public IP address and DNS name.

- 5 The Controller configures the ALB. It tells the ALB: "Listen for incoming requests on port 80. If a request has the path /products, forward it to the pods of the product-service."

- 6 The ALB starts receiving traffic. Now that the factory is built and configured, it can start doing its job.

The confusion arises because the Ingress is the "what" you want to do, and the LoadBalancer is the "how" it gets done. They are two different parts of the same system.

## 📌 🤔 so instead of writing path based rules in ingress can you not write them in application load balancer in aws directly? ## 

Yes, you absolutely can configure path-based routing directly in the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) console. You don't have to use a Kubernetes Ingress object.

**Ingress vs. Manual ALB Configuration**
The key difference lies in the automation and management model.

***The Kubernetes Way (using Ingress) 🤖***
- Declarative: You define your routing rules in a simple YAML file (Ingress).

- Automated: The AWS Load Balancer Controller automatically reads this file and provisions and configures the ALB for you.

- Integrated: The routing is tied directly to your Kubernetes services. If a service's IP changes or new pods are added, the controller automatically updates the ALB's target groups.

- Version Controlled: Your routing logic lives with your application's code and can be managed with Git.

- Ideal for EKS: This is the standard, best practice for EKS as it integrates your application's network configuration with the Kubernetes control plane.

**The Manual AWS Way ✍️**
- Imperative: You log into the AWS console and manually create the ALB, add listeners, and define the path-based routing rules.

- Disconnected: The ALB has no direct knowledge of your Kubernetes services. You would have to manually create and manage Target Groups and ensure the correct pod IPs are registered as targets.

- Manual Updates: If a pod's IP address changes or a new replica is added, you would have to manually update the target group configuration. This is not scalable or realistic for a dynamic containerized environment.

- Operational Overhead: You are responsible for all the manual work and configuration, which can lead to human error and downtime.

In a production EKS environment, manually managing the ALB is not feasible. The Kubernetes Ingress resource, combined with the AWS Load Balancer Controller, is the bridge that automates this entire process for you, making your infrastructure scalable and reliable.

## 📌 🤔 now there is more confusion , if you can use ingress rules that are implemented by applicaiton load balancer then now why do you need aws api gateway? ## 

**That's an excellent question that gets to the core of modern cloud architecture. It highlights the difference between a simple reverse proxy and a full-featured API Gateway.**

You can think of it this way: Ingress implemented by an ALB is a simple, powerful router for your web traffic. An API Gateway is a specialized tool for managing the entire API lifecycle, with features far beyond basic routing.

While both can perform path-based routing, they are built for fundamentally different purposes. Here's a breakdown of why you might need AWS API Gateway even when you're already using Ingress.

As we discussed, Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that defines rules for HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Its primary function is to:

- Load Balancing: Distribute incoming web traffic to your pods.

- Routing: Send requests based on the URL path (/products, /users, etc.) or hostname.

- TLS Termination: Handle SSL certificates to secure traffic.

This is a perfect solution for a typical web application where you just need to route user requests to the correct backend microservice. It's lightweight, tightly integrated with Kubernetes, and very cost-effective.

#### AWS API Gateway's Role: A Full-Featured API Management Tool 🛡️ ####
***AWS API Gateway*** is a fully managed AWS service that sits at the very edge of your network, often in front of your EKS cluster and its Ingress. Its job is to provide a comprehensive suite of features for managing your APIs.

You would use API Gateway for the following advanced functionalities that Ingress does not provide:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** API Gateway can handle complex security for you. It can validate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), integrate with Amazon Cognito, or use custom Lambda authorizers to verify who is calling your APIs before the request ever reaches your EKS cluster.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** You can configure fine-grained controls to prevent your APIs from being overwhelmed. For example, you could limit a specific user to 100 requests per minute and automatically throttle them if they exceed that.

- **API Key Management and Usage Plans:** If you're building an API for third-party developers, API Gateway allows you to create and manage API keys, track usage, and define different subscription tiers.

- **Request and Response Transformation:** You can modify the payload of an incoming request or an outgoing response on the fly. This is useful for translating data formats, hiding internal details, or creating a simpler API for external clients.

- **Versioning:** API Gateway simplifies managing multiple versions of your API (/v1/products, /v2/products), allowing you to deploy new versions without breaking older clients.

- **Integration with Other AWS Services:** API Gateway can directly integrate with other AWS services like Lambda, DynamoDB, or S3, allowing you to build serverless backends without using EKS at all for some services.

##### The Combined Architecture #####
In many advanced microservices architectures, teams use both Ingress and AWS API Gateway together.

- AWS API Gateway acts as the public-facing entry point for all external, third-party clients. It handles all the complex API management tasks like security, versioning, and usage plans.

- Ingress (via the ALB) is then used behind the API Gateway to route internal or trusted traffic to the correct microservice within the EKS cluster.

This architecture lets you leverage the powerful, specialized features of AWS API Gateway for your public APIs while still using the efficient, Kubernetes-native Ingress for traffic within your cluster.

## 📌 🤔  so can you draw this full multi layer architecture in a very detailed ascii diagram? ##
Here is a diagram illustrating how AWS API Gateway and a Kubernetes Ingress work together in a multi-layered architecture:

#### Key Takeaways from the Diagram ####
 - **External Entry Point:** A user request first hits the AWS API Gateway. This is the public-facing component that handles all the high-level API management tasks.

- **Routing to the Cluster:** The API Gateway, after performing its checks (like authentication and rate limiting), forwards the request to the Application Load Balancer (ALB), which is configured as the Kubernetes Ingress.

- **Internal Routing:** The Ingress controller in the EKS cluster then takes over. It routes the request to the correct microservice pod based on the path and rules you have defined in your Ingress resource.

- **Separation of Concerns:** This multi-layered approach provides a clear separation of concerns. The API Gateway handles external security, management, and developer-facing features, while the Ingress controller efficiently routes traffic within the cluster to your internal microservices.

#### 1. External Traffic Flow: From User to API Gateway ####
   The journey begins outside your cloud environment.

- **User Traffic:** A request starts from a user's browser or a client application.

- **Route 53:** As the DNS service, it translates the domain name (e.g., api.example.com) to the IP address of your API Gateway, acting as the first point of contact.

- **AWS API Gateway:** This is not a simple router. It serves as a comprehensive API management layer. At this stage, it handles critical tasks that don't need to be managed by your Kubernetes cluster:

- **Authentication/Authorization:** Verifies API keys, validates JWTs, or runs custom Lambda authorizers to ensure the request is from a legitimate source.

- **Rate Limiting/Throttling:** Protects your downstream services by controlling the number of requests per client.

- **Request/Response** Transformation: Can modify the incoming request or outgoing response to fit the contract of your internal services.

#### 2. The Ingress Layer: Application Load Balancer and VPC ####
   Once the request is authenticated, it moves into your VPC, where the routing magic happens.

- **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB):** The API Gateway forwards the request to the ALB. The ALB is an integral part of your Kubernetes networking, acting as the Ingress Controller. It performs SSL/TLS termination and intelligently routes traffic based on Layer 7 rules.

- **AWS Load Balancer Controller:** This is an open-source Kubernetes controller that runs inside your EKS cluster. Its job is to watch for Ingress and Service resources and automatically provision and configure the corresponding AWS ALB.

- **Ingress Rules:** These are the Kubernetes resources you define in YAML. They declaratively tell the ALB how to route traffic. For example, a rule might say, "for a request to /products/*, send it to the products-service." The ALB Controller translates these rules into the ALB's configuration.

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** This is your isolated, private network in AWS. The ALB, EKS Control Plane, and Worker Nodes all reside within this secure boundary, often across multiple public and private subnets.

#### 3. Inside the EKS Cluster: Control Plane and Worker Nodes ####
   This is the core of your application where your microservices run.

- **EKS Control Plane:** This is a fully managed service that handles the orchestration of your cluster. It includes:

   - **API Server:** The central hub that exposes the Kubernetes API. All communication to and from the cluster goes through the API Server.

   - **Scheduler:** Determines which Worker Node is the best fit to run a newly created pod, based on resource availability and other constraints.

- **EKS Worker Nodes:** These are the underlying EC2 instances that provide the compute power for your containers.

- **Pods:** The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A pod encapsulates one or more containers (your microservices).

- **Kubernetes Services:** These provide a stable networking endpoint for a set of pods. This is a crucial concept, as pod IPs are ephemeral and can change. The two primary types used here are:

   - **ClusterIP:** Exposes the service on a virtual IP address that is only reachable from within the cluster. It's the standard way for microservices to communicate with each other. For example, if a "cart" microservice needs to talk to a "database" microservice, it uses the database's ClusterIP.

   - **LoadBalancer Service Type:** This is a direct way to expose a service to the internet by provisioning a standard AWS Load Balancer. It is used when you need to expose a single service directly, without the advanced path-based routing capabilities of an Ingress.

The Flow of a Request
1. A user makes a request to https://api.example.com/products.

2. Route 53 resolves the domain to the AWS API Gateway.

3. API Gateway validates the request's credentials and checks for rate limits.

4. The request is then forwarded to the AWS ALB.

5. The ALB, based on the Ingress Rules configured by the AWS Load Balancer Controller, sees the /products path and routes the traffic to the Kubernetes Service for the products microservice.

6. The Kubernetes Service (using its ClusterIP) load balances the request across the available pods running the products microservice.

7. The microservice in the pod processes the request and sends a response back along the same path.
